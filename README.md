# Stanford Climate Ventures: AviE Project
This repository is used for storing vehicles and test cases used in our Electric Cargo Aircraft project for the Stanford Climate Ventures course (ERE 203). In this project, we assess the feasibility of all-electric cargo aircraft and compare performance to current cargo aircraft of similar weight classes. Optimization of the aircraft design for increased efficiency, as well as potential market share, for each weight class will be performed. 


# Dependencies
This project uses SUAVE, an open source aircraft design tool developed in the Aerospace Design Lab at Stanford.
